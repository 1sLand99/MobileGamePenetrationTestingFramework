# Mobile Game Penetration Testing Framework  [中文介绍](README-CN.md)

This is a penetration testing framework for Android mobile games, integrating attack tools targeting Unity, IL2CPP, Mono, and Lua game frameworks. The tools include features such as speed hacking, script decryption, code injection, function hooking, virtualization, stealth hooking, memory data monitoring APIs, along with a series of auxiliary tools.

The framework covers a wide range of knowledge areas, including game engines, Android source code analysis, compiler principles, multiple programming languages, kernel driver development, JNI development, virtualization, cryptography, ELF files, dynamic defense, reverse engineering, and code engineering.

It is hoped that this project will bring greater convenience and inspiration to future researchers, reduce their research costs, and achieve the goal of "planting trees for others to enjoy the shade."

The framework also supports game crawling, automated testing, resource decryption, vulnerability research, code decryption, penetration testing, and more.

The specific purpose and usage of the code can be learned by referring to the .cpp files in the project's root directory.
